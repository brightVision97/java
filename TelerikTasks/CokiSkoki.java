/**
 * Coki likes to make skok-podskok.
 * <p>
 * Recently Koci, his evil genius twin, used this weakness of Coki and started making experiments on him.
 * The last experiment was successful and now Coki gained the superpower to make really big skoks (jumps).
 * Now, Coki is known as the masked vigilante The Big Skok, with the cape and underwear-above-the-pants stuff.
 * <p>
 * He wants to try his newfound powers. He is in the city, and there are really high buildings there.
 * He wants to try to make the longest possible sequence of jumps.
 * Since Coki is still pretty new at this, he can jump only on buildings that are
 * higher than the one he is on, and also there are not higher buildings between.
 * Also, Coki can jump only from left to right.
 * <p>
 * Help Coki to hone his powers!
 * <p>
 * The heights of the buildings are represented as a sequence of numbers.
 * You task is to find the longest sequence of jumps that Coki can make, starting from each building.
